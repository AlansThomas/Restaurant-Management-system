They can configure and update information related to the hotel, including its facilities, menu, and table availability.
This module also allows administrators to manage user accounts and provide customer support.

### Hotel Module

The Hotel module focuses on managing the specific hotel's resources.
It enables hotel staff to keep track of reservations, allocate tables, and ensure that the dining experience runs smoothly. 
This module is instrumental in streamlining the hotel's daily operations and ensuring that reservations are handled efficiently.
